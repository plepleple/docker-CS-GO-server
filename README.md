# docker-CS-GO-server

This repository contains Dokerfile of Counter Strike: Global Offensive. It was created to fast-deploy CS:GO server within Docker.

In Docker Hub there is already created image of CS:GO, but I think that there is no good documentation, how to run it, etc.

Counter Strike: Global Offensive on [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive)

Enjoy. GL&HF
